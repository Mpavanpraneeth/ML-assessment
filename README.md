Healthcare Readmission Prediction 

Dataset: UCI Medical Readmission Dataset (available from UCI Machine Learning Repository 

Task Requirements: 

    Handle mixed data types including categorical, numerical, and time-series elements from patient records 

- Implement feature selection techniques to identify the most clinically relevant predictors while avoiding overfitting
- Address missing data using advanced imputation techniques beyond simple mean/median, considering medical context
- Build and compare traditional ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM) with proper handling of time-based data leakage
- Implement a model calibration process to ensure probability estimates are reliable for clinical decision making
- Create a model interpretability report suitable for healthcare professionals
     

Evaluation Criteria: 

    Brier score and calibration plots
    Clinical utility analysis showing potential impact on patient outcomes
    Feature importance analysis with medical justification
